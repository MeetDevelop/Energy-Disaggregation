# Energy Disaggregation

This project aim to apply some machine learning techniques on the energy disaggregation problem.

## Dataset

We use the low-freq (at 1Hz) of [REDD dataset](http://redd.csail.mit.edu/). You can download it [here](http://redd.csail.mit.edu/) with the id/password : redd/disaggregatetheenergy.

Extract the dataset and put it in the same directory with the jupyter notebook file

## Requirement

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Tensorflow
- Keras
